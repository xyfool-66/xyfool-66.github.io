# 👀 About me
As an IEEE student member, I am currently pursuing my studies at the School of Information Technology and Engineering, Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing. I hold the distinction of being the top-ranked honors student in the School of Information Science and Technology. During 2022 and 2023, I am a member of Zhishan Student Lecture Group at Southeast University.

I am thrilled to share that I have been accepted into the EAS program at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and will commence my Ph.D. program in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE) starting in the Fall of 2024. My research interests include secure neural network inference, privacy-preserving federated learning, and related topics.
