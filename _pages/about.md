# 👀 About me
As an IEEE student member, I am working at Lab of Efficient Architectures for Digital-communication and Signal-processing (LEADS) and National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I am the honours (ranking first) student of School of Informmation Science and Technology. During 2022 and 2023, I am a member of Zhishan Student Lecture Group of Southeast University. My research interest includes channel estimation, compressive sensing, and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in wireless communication of 5G and 6G.
You can find my [CV](http://xyfool-66.github.io/files/cv.pdf) here.
